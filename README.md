# Netflix-Clone
🎬 Netflix Clone

This project is a Netflix landing page clone created using HTML5 and CSS3. The main purpose of the project is to practice website layout design, responsive styling, and modern UI concepts by recreating the visual structure of a popular streaming platform.

The webpage includes a hero section with a background image and gradient overlay, a navigation bar with logo, language selection, and sign-in button, and an email signup form for user interaction. Multiple feature sections are designed using flexbox to present content in a clean and organized manner.

An FAQ section is implemented using a CSS-only accordion, demonstrating how interactivity can be achieved without JavaScript. The page also contains a footer with multiple columns of links, similar to a real Netflix website.

The design is fully responsive, adjusting layout, text sizes, and images for smaller screens using media queries. Overall, this project highlights the effective use of HTML structure and CSS styling to build a professional, responsive, and visually appealing landing page for learning and frontend development practice.
